# LearnEstonianWeb
The objective is to demonstrate my understanding of server-side web development and mastery of the Python Flask micro-framework.

This project aims to create an online application that will expose prospective students to the Estonian language and culture, inquire about their proficiency level, and display learning-related information. "LearnEstonian" is designed to be a complete language learning solution for anyone worldwide who wants to learn Estonia's distinctive and beautiful language. 
This initiative is motivated by the multiculturalism of Estonia as well as the global need to  learn less widely spoken languages for travel, business, and personal growth
