      <h1>Exploring Estonian Culture</h1>
      <h4>Estonia does not need to compete to be seen since it is completely unique. Although its topography and history are similar to those of Latvia and Lithuania, its culture is distinct. Despite 50 years of Soviet control, Finland is Estonia's most closely related linguistic and ethnic neighbour. Estonia has been tied to Russia for the last 300 years, although the two countries share as much in common as a barn swallow and a bear (their respective national emblems).

        <div class="fact-one-description">
            <h3>1.Estonian language has more sounds than standard Latin.</h3>
            <p>The modern Estonian language is written in Latin language alphabet (Roman script). According to the Estonian accent, some words could not be covered with the basic latin alphabets. Hence, specific diacritic marks are added to produce certain sounds.</p>
        </div>
              <div class="fact-two-description">
            <h3>2.An Estonian sentence can have endless compounds.</h3>
            <p>This is interesting about the Estonian language is that a sentence can be framed with any number of compounds. In Estonian, it is possible to form endless compounds by converting the first word into the next word’s genitive (relating nouns or pronouns by indicating a close association).</p>
<p>For example, the sentence- anna õlu üle Ülo õe õla. (meaning- hand the beer over Ülo’s sister’s shoulder.)</p>
